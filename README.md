# Jeff Camacho's Personal Site

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, powered by Jekyll. This site is a canvas for my professional journey, a platform for sharing insights, and a bridge connecting with like-minded individuals and teams.

## About Me

I'm Jeff Camacho, an Agile software development enthusiast with a history in the Army and academia. From repairing specialized electronics, to a squad leader of soldiers, to excelling in Electrical Engineering and an MBA program, my path has been anything but ordinary. Currently, I'm steering projects at BigBear.ai, where we're shaping software solutions for our customers with precision and agility.

Beyond the bits and bytes, I've ventured into entrepreneurship, wielding a broom with the same finesse I use to manage code. My ventures and experiences have honed my expertise in team leadership, project management, and operational efficiency.

I believe in lifelong learning and dedicate myself to coaching veterans and service members, sharing the wisdom gained from every step of my journey.
