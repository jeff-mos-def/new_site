**Work is like a hill**, divides Every piece of work to two phases - **An uphill**, a phase of figuring out the approach and **a downhill**, the phase of execution. 

The Hill Chart diagram looks like a broad bell curve, with a vertical dotted line down the middle. The left edge is the start (figuring out), the right end is the finish (execution). This feature is available in [[Basecamp]].
