There are two systems of thinking - System 1 and System 2. Consider system 1 as reactive, and system 2 as analytical.  System 1 (Thinking Fast) is the intuitive, reactive way of thinking based on first impression and quick reaction. (Jumping to conclusion) and System 2 (Thinking Slow) is about reflection, analysis, and problem-solving.

We think that we are rational and analytical, but that's wrong. We use system 1 more often than system 2. *In a way, feeling that we use System 2 more itself results from System 1 thinking. Analyze and you will know you are wrong ;)*

System 2 only gets involved when we encounter something unexpected that System 1 canâ€™t automatically process. System 1 is accurate at times. But it can make error due to [[Bias]] Also, System 1 sometimes answers easier questions than answering the real problem
