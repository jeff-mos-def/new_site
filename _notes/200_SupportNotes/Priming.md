In Psychology, Priming is a phenomenon whereby previous stimulus influences a response to a subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention. *For example, the word NURSE is recognised more quickly following the word DOCTOR than following the word BREAD.* 

Priming works most effectively when the two stimuli are in the same modality. For example, visual priming works best with visual cues and verbal priming works best with verbal cues.
