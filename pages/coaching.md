I offer coaching for individuals or teams looking to improve their design skills and knowledge. I provide 1:1 sessions like portfolio reviews and mock interviews on <a href="https://topmate.io/hiran">topmate</a>, and 30-minute design mentoring via <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/hiran-venugopalan">ADPList</a>. If you're interested in other coaching models or have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:hi@hiran.in">email</a> me.

## For Teams
For Product or Design Teams, I conduct workshops and coaching sessions on design thinking, design tools, and design process. The duration, content, and format of the workshop will be customized as per the team's requirements.

## For Founders
As a Founder/CXO, you can benefit from my guidance on design principles, design thinking, and design team processes. My insights can help shape the success of your product.

## For Products
If you require expert feedback and validation for your projects or products, I provide unlimited asynchronous design feedback via Figma or email for a fixed monthly retainer of $300. Please note that I will not be creating designs for you, but rather providing insights to enhance your design.
