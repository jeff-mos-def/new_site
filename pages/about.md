Hi, I'm Jeff Camacho. If we could share a moment, I'd start with my time in the Army, which was more than just a rite of passage. Despite lacking high school accolades, military life opened my eyes to the world in unparalleled ways. I handled specialized electronics, acted as a squad leader to soldiers, and along the journey, absorbed invaluable lessons in discipline and teamwork, my guiding principles to this day.

Moving on, I found myself immersed in electrical engineering and an MBA at Texas State and A&M, where I discovered my academic potential and achieved a flawless GPA.

Today, I'm fully engaged in Agile software development at BigBear.ai. In this role, I have the privilege of guiding brilliant tech minds, navigating the complexities of crafting software for the Air Force. It's about maintaining agility, keeping our goals in sight, and the satisfaction of a well-executed plan.

Beyond technology, I've ventured into entrepreneurship with a cleaning service, honing a foolproof marketing approach and upholding a staunch commitment to safety.

Throughout my journey from the military to the tech peaks of Silicon Hills, I've gleaned insights on leading teams, managing multiple projects, and enhancing operational workflows. While certifications and titles tell part of the story, for me, the essence lies in fostering team spirit, refining processes, and the shared stride towards progress.

Being a self-learner, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and provide coaching and mentoring to veterans and service members. Other interest includes reading, movies, and traveling.
